@name wishes to make a request.

@name, can you put yourself in a frame of mind where you genuinely want an honest answer to a question?

Or, where you want help with something, but only if it can be given willingly and compassionately?

If so, please make your request.

If not, or if the request is not appropriate to the channel, or if you canâ€™t frame it appropriately, please mark this post with an emoji reply (such as :no_entry_sign:) or say something like [MOVE ON].
