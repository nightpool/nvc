... it would be kind if everyone seeing this paused for a moment. 

Give @name a moment to identify their feelings and needs. Nobody has to share them, nobody has to listen to them, the conversation can continue in a moment, but ... please, just, a few seconds’ pause.

(@name, if things are moving too fast for you to do that ... if the moment you get is not enough ... please take a few minutes’ break away from the channel, or with only tentative attention to this channel, to sort out your thoughts. Consider asking for help on an appropriate channel afterwards with “/need spotted” if you found one or “/request” if you did not.)
