@name, thank you for recognizing that you’re not up for this right now. Please take whatever time you need to recognize the hurt that’s in your way, to empathize with yourself, and to engage with what you need right now instead.

**Everyone else seeing this** … @name is going to stop talking on this channel for a bit; please allow them to gracefully depart. You may feel free to continue your discussion amongst yourselves.
