So, as I understand it, @name is suggesting there’s a perspective that wasn’t previously considered here, that might change the conversation a little: [thought]

It would be kind if everyone seeing this paused for a few moments to give those who are willing space to consider this thought.

@name2, if you have thoughts or a response, you may offer them in good faith.

If you don’t know how to respond to this, it is sufficient to take a moment or two to reflect on it, then acknowledge that you’ve heard it (e.g., “cool,” “sure thing,” “sorry,” “fair point,” “noted,”) and move on.
