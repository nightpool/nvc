So, as I understand it, @name would like to suggest a perspective we haven't considered here yet:

    **[thought]**


[no_user]
It would be kind to pause and process for a moment before picking up the conversation and continuing on.

It'd be kind to pause and process a moment before continuing the conversation.
    @name2, if you have thoughts or a response, you may offer them in good faith.
    ... if you don’t know how to respond, it's enough to take a moment to reflect; acknowledge that you’ve heard it (e.g., “cool,” "sorry," “fair point."); and, move on.
