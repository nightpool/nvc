Brief pause:


[no_user]
@name thinks @name has identified a need of theirs. @name, if it’s relevant to the conversation, and an appropriate thing to say, and you’re up for talking about it, could you describe the needs behind your feelings ... and possibly even make a request?

... if it’s not relevant to the conversation, or you’re not up for talking about it, you can just put an emoji reply on this (such as :no_entry_sign:) ... or say something like [MOVE ON].

[user]
@name thinks @name has identified a need of someone else’s. @name, if it’s relevant to the conversation, and it’s an appropriate thing to say, could you paraphrase that need here, and ask whether you’ve identified those needs correctly? If it’s not relevant or not appropriate, you can redirect that part of the conversation to a more appropriate channel ... or just put an emoji reply on this (such as :no-entry-sign:), or, say something like [MOVE ON].
