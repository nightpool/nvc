Brief pause:

@name thinks @name has identified a need of theirs. @name, if it’s relevant to the conversation, and an appropriate thing to say, and you’re up for talking about it, could you describe the needs behind your feelings ... and possibly even make a request?

... if it’s not relevant to the conversation, or you’re not up for talking about it, you can just put an emoji reply on this (such as :no_entry_sign:) ... or say something like [MOVE ON].
