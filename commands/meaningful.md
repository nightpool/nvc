Thank you for having meaningful communication on Ninuan!

I’d like to ask that you move on to an attempt at reflection—that you either:

    1 ... attempt to reflect the other person’s feelings by paraphrasing what you’ve understood from them, and asking if that’s correct, in which case I’d also like it if they either gave you an honest answer or admitted something like [HONESTY IMPOSSIBLE], *or*

    2 ... ask the other person to paraphrase what they understand you to be saying—to reflect it back to you; in which case, I’d also like to ask that they do so, or admit something like [HONESTY IMPOSSIBLE] if they can’t; and that you reply with honesty or [HONESTY IMPOSSIBLE] in kind.

You can let people know which you’re going to do with a 1 or 2 emoji if you’re a slow typist.
If you can’t do either, you can mark this with a no entry sign emoji, or say something like [MOVE ON].
