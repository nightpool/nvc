**Everyone seeing this**, please pause for 20 seconds.

First, a slight clarification and reminder. Using !anger means that one feels anger. Using !judge means that one feels judgmental. It doesn’t make the anger or judgment “right,” but it also doesn’t make it wrong to have and be open about those feelings.

@name, thank you for accepting that your feelings of anger and judgment are their own thing, connected but not intrinsically bound to who’s correct. If you’re willing to go a step further than that, look past your anger and judgment, and try to connect here, mark this with an XP, Fugue, or meowheart.

@name2, if they do so, please consider putting down what you were otherwise saying for a moment to stop and tell @name something about your feelings and needs, instead—if necessary, directing that part of the conversation first to another, more appropriate, channel.
