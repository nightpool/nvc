[pause]

@name, please take a few minutes here; please observe what others are saying or doing that’s enriching or not enriching your life. Then, either here or on a more appropriate channel, please either:

  ❧ if you’re feeling pain, announce that pain and its nature,
      nakedly and without assigning blame; or

  ❧ if you’re feeling other things, share
      what you’re feeling, instead.
 
Because this will take a few minutes, and may be addressed on another channel, **there is no need for others to pause**; however, if possible, everyone, please hold off briefly on statements that must be answered by, or, push directly on, @name.
